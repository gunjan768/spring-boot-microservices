Redis stands for Remote Dictionary Server. It is a non-sql db and uses data structures to store data: String, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes, bitmaps, hyperlogs
and geopatial inexes. It is an in-memory db (with persistence options).

Features:
. Has a single text file for all configurations
. Is single threaded - one action at a time
. Pipelining (we can cluster multiple commands and send them at once)
