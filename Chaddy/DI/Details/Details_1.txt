Bean Licfecycle Methods/Hooks:
. You can custom code during bean intialization
. You can add custom code during bean destruction

. Simply define your methods for initialization and destroy and then all you do is you add annotations to those methods and the annotations are @PostConstruct for initialization and
@PreDestroy for destroy.

Note: For "prototype" scoped beans, Spring does not call the @PreDestroy method
