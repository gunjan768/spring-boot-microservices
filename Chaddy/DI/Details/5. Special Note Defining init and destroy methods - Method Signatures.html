<p><strong>Special Note about init and destroy Method Signatures</strong></p>







<p>When using XML configuration, I want to provide additional details regarding the method signatures of the <code>init-method</code>&nbsp; and <code>destroy-method</code>&nbsp;.<strong><br></strong></p>





<p><strong>Access modifier</strong><br>The method can have any access modifier (public, protected, private)</p>







<p><strong>Return type</strong><br>The method can have any return type. However, "void' is most commonly used. If you give a return type just note that you will not be able to capture the return value. As a result, "void" is commonly used.</p>











<p><strong>Method name</strong><br>The method can have any method name.</p>











<p><strong>Arguments</strong><br>The method can not accept any arguments. The method should be no-arg.</p>
