Using Data Rest --->

Advanced features of Spring Data Rest:
. Pagination, sorting and searching
. Extending and adding custom queries with JPQL
. Query Domain Specific Laguage (Query DSL)

. Spring Data Rest doen't handle complex pluralized forms like for 'Person', plural form is 'People'. In this case, we need to specify plural form.
. What if we have Entity name = Employee but we want endpoint path with our choice (default will be 'employees'). We can do it by using @RepositoryRestResource(path="any_name")

Pagination:
. By default, Spring Data Rest will return the first 20 elements (so page size = 20).  
. We can navigate to different pages using query param (pages are 0 based): http://localhost:8080/employees?page=2
. We can set the properties like base-path, page size etc in application.properties

Sorting:
. We can sort by the property names of your entity. Ascending is default. Example: http://localhost:8080/employees?sort=lastName,firstName,desc (first by firstName then by lastName)
