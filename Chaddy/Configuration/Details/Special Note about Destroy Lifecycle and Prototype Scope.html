<p>Here is a subtle point you need to be aware of with "prototype" scoped beans.</p><p><strong>For "prototype" scoped beans, Spring does not call the @PreDestroy method.&nbsp; Gasp!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I didn't know this either until I dug through the Spring reference manual researching a student's question.</p><p>Here is the answer from the Spring reference manual.

This examples shows how to destroy prototype scoped beans.</p><p>1. Create a custom bean processor. This bean processor will keep track of prototype scoped beans. During shutdown it will call the destroy() method on the prototype scoped beans.</p><p>2. The prototype scoped beans MUST implement the DisposableBean interface. This interface defines a "destroy()" method. This method should be used instead of the @PreDestroy annotation.</p><p>3. In this app, BeanProcessorDemoApp.java is the main program. TennisCoach.java is the prototype scoped bean. TennisCoach implements the DisposableBean interface and provides the destroy() method. The custom bean processing is handled in the MyCustomBeanProcessor class.</p><p>See source code here for details: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=11YZhzKjLJVhvsMsNjKU7jMrzTHlxwvkT" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>destroy-protoscope-bean-with-custom-processor.zip</strong></a></p><p><br></p>
