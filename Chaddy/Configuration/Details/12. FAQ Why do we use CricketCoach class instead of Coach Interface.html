<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">Question:</strong></p>

<p>For the CricketCoach example with Setter Injection, why do we use the CricketCoach class instead of the Coach interface?</p>







<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br></p>







<p>The getTeam() method is only defined in the CricketCoach class. It is not part of the Coach interface.</p>









<p>As a result, you would need the following code:</p>









<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>CricketCoach theCricketCoach = context.getBean("myCricketCoach", CricketCoach.class);</code>&nbsp;</p>









<p>---</p>









<p>The Coach interface has two methods: getDailyWorkout and getDailyFortune</p>









<p>The CricketCoach class has four methods: getDailyWorkout, getDailyFortune, getTeam and setTeam</p>









<p>---</p>









<p>When you retrieve a bean from the Spring container using the Coach interface:</p>









<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>Coach theCricketCoach = context.getBean("myCricketCoach", Coach.class);</code>&nbsp;</p>









<p>You only have access to the methods defined in the Coach interface: getDailyWorkout and getDailyFortune. Even though the actual implementation has additional methods, you only have visibility to methods that are defined at the Coach interface level.</p>

<p>ALSO, you have access to the additional methods defined in the CricketCoach class: getTeam, setTeam.</p>

<p>The bottom line is it depends on how you retrieve the object and assign it ... that determines the visibility you have to the methods.</p>
