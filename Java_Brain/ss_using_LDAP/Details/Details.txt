Q) What is LDAP ?
. LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a software protocol for enabling anyone to locate data about organizations, individuals and other resources such as 
files and devices in a network -- whether on the public internet or on a corporate intranet. LDAP is a "lightweight" (smaller amount of code) version of Directory 
Access Protocol (DAP).

. A directory tells the user where in the network something is located. On TCP/IP networks (including the internet), the domain name system (DNS) is the directory 
system used to relate the domain name to a specific network address (a unique location on the network). However, the user may not know the domain name. LDAP allows 
a user to search for an individual without knowing where they're located (although additional information will help with the search).

--> Uses of LDAP

. The common use of LDAP is to provide a central place for authentication -- meaning it stores usernames and passwords. LDAP can then be used in different applications 
or services to validate users with a plugin. As some examples, LDAP can be used to validate usernames and passwords with Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes. LDAP can also be 
used to add operations into a directory server database, authenticate -- or bind -- sessions, delete LDAP entries, search and compare entries using different commands,
 modify existing entries, extend entries, abandon requests or unbind operations.

Connect SB to LDAP: We want SB to connect to the LDAP server which contains all these information in order to identify a user say somebody tries to enter with username
and password, our SS app contacts the LDAP server to get that user information and authenticates against LDAP. SS has some out of the box classes to connect with LDAP.
