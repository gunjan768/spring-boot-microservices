. CrudRepository<T, G> returns an Iterator interface type where as JpaRepository<T, G> extends the CrudRepository and have more features like it returns an Optional.

--> To have basic method in our repository interface (which extends either CrudRepository<T, G> or JpaRepository<T, G>), we don't have to implement (define the body) 
the body (we can define the default or static method in the interface), just declare the method name with the "findByProperty" name format and the Spring Data JPA
will implement the method for us. Remember that method name should be in camel case.

--> We want to write method for the field which is an instance of some class for example: class Course { Topic topic; }. We want to write a db method for "topic"
instance. Topic { String id; }. in this case we need to also mention the property of a class like here we need to mentiond the "id" field if we want to find by id.
So final method will look like: findByTopicId(String topicId);
